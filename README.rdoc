#Banner ad screenshot utility built in AIR

##Ever get tasked with delivering 100+ banner ads in SWF and JPG form to media outlets? 

Sometimes you can export the last frame from the Flash IDE, but what if you have actionscript that controls the look of the ad? Even IDE exporting takes 6+ clicks. Multiply that by 100.

This tool allows you to easily select both AS2 and AS3 banner ads and save JPGs of the last frame of the ad. It can handle large numbers of ads simultaneously too.
